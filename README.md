# Network-Traffic-Prediction-Model-Considering-Road-Traffic-Parameters-Using-Artificial-Intelligence-
Determined a model for deciding organizing sell goods this district review by attractive a examine the determinants that can cause roadway traffic. The throwed model uses a Random Forest-Gated Recurrent Unit-Network Traffic Prediction forecast (RF-GRU-NTP) to expect network traffic stream happen traffic and organization traffic into report.This model is containing three parts: expecting traffic that will use the V2V (vehicle to vechile) compromise, expecting traffic that will use the V2R (vehicle to road) understanding, and predicting traffic that will use two together the V2V and V2R contracts. The main elements from the linked dataset, that contains two V2V and V2R interchanges, are picked utilizing the Random Forest (RF) machine learning belief design later the second stage, when the cross breed model is begun. From that point forward, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) calculation is utilized to anticipate the traffic stream in the organization utilizing deep learning calculations. As per the experimental outcomes, the proposed RF-GRU-NTP model beats different calculations used to anticipate network traffic as far as its precision and time to run.
